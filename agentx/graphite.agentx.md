# Graphite Branching Workflow

Developer branching workflow using [Graphite](https://graphite.dev/) for stacked PRs and collaborative feature work.

---

## Install

```bash
npm install -g @withgraphite/graphite-cli
```

## Auth

```bash
gt auth
```

---

## Workflow: Stacked Branches

### Create your stack

```bash
# Base feature branch
gt branch create feature/claim-era-status

# Your work stacked on top
gt branch create feature/claim-era-status-johnny
```

### Teammate does the same

```bash
# Arsen creates the same base
gt branch create feature/claim-era-status

# Arsen's work stacked on top
gt branch create feature/claim-era-status-arsen
```

### When a teammate merges their PR

```bash
gt sync
```

This automatically rebases your stacked branch on top of the updated base — no manual pulling.

### Submit PRs in the correct order

```bash
gt submit
```

Opens PRs in dependency order (base first, then stacked branches).
